# **Security Policy**

The Tangle team takes the security of our project seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and our community to help us ensure our software is secure.

## **Reporting a Vulnerability**

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We use GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting feature, which allows you to privately disclose a security vulnerability to the project maintainers.

1. **Go to the "Security" tab** of the Tangle repository.
2. Click on **"Report a vulnerability"** or go directly to `https://github.com/TangleML/tangle/security/advisories/new`
3. Fill out the form with as much detail as possible, including:
   * A description of the vulnerability.
   * The component or code path affected.
   * The version(s) affected.
   * Steps to reproduce the issue or a proof-of-concept (PoC).
   * Any potential impact (e.g., data exfiltration, denial of service).

### **Alternative Contact**

If for any reason you cannot use GitHub's private reporting, you can send an email to our private security-list: **`security@tangleml.com`**. Please use "Tangle Security Vulnerability" as the subject line.

## **Our Commitment**

When you report a vulnerability to us, we commit to the following:

* We will acknowledge your report within **5 business days**.
* We will work with you to understand the issue and confirm its validity.
* We will provide a timeline for a fix and keep you updated on our progress.
* We will coordinate with you on a public disclosure and advisory. We will credit you for your discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
